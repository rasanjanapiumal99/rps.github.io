# Unit Converter

This is a simple unit converter web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to convert various units across different categories, including length, mass, time, volume, fluid volume, velocity, force, energy, power, density, pressure, electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, frequency, and temperature.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter a value in the "Enter Value" field.
4. Select the source category from the dropdown list.
